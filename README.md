# Sri_house

The Dataset contains the prices of Sri Lankan houses in all regions. Sri Lankan Real Estate related data sources are scarce and that is why created this dataset. I wanted to create this dataset so that all the data scientists out there could easily use this in their projects. The process of data collection when done manually is very tedious and is a boring process especially when there are thousands of data points. I wrote an automated script to scrape new data so that I can keep the dataset up to date.
